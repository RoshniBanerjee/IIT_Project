# Introduction
PlncRNA-HDeep is a method using hybrid deep leaning based on two encoding styles for plant lncRNA prediction. It is implemented by Keras and all main scripts are written by Python on PC under a Microsoft Windows 10 operating system.

The repository can be downloaded locally by clicking "clone or download" button. PlncRNA-HDeep can be applied directly without installation.
